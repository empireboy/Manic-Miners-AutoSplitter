# Manic Miners AutoSplitter

Manic Miners AutoSplitter is a tool that automatically splits your times when using [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/).

Manic Miners is a [Lego Rock Raiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Rock_Raiders_(video_game)) (1999) remake made by Baraklava.

## Current features
- There is a setting that let's you toggle between full game runs and level runs.
- Splits whenever you press Finish or (Finish) Fast.

Full Game Run:
- Starts whenever you click on any level in the campaign menu.

Level Run:
- Starts whenever you click on the play button in the instructions menu of a specific level.

## What if it doesn't auto split?

There should be a small change that the memory addresses associated with the auto-splitter are not correct, in this case a restart of the game should fix it.
